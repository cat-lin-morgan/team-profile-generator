# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This was a team profile generator using Javascript, the Inquirer NPM , Node, and Jest for testing.

**Extra:**
Something that might not be immediately obvious are when giving the option of which role each employee gets, besides the manager, will unlock each own's respective secondary question.

I also added input validation to all my questions.

**Other:** I added clickability to all links and added extra icons for fun.
